// Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a sorted array or list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.


// Here's a basic outline of how binary search works:

// 1.Initialize: Define the search range. Initially, this is the entire array.

//2. Midpoint: Find the middle element of the current range.

//3. Compare: Compare the middle element with the target value.     

// 4. Adjust the range: If the middle element is equal to the target, the search is successful. If the middle element is greater than the target, update the range to the lower half. If the middle element is less than the target, update the range to the upper half.

// 5.  Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until the target is found or the search range becomes empty.

//06. if end become smaller than start thats mean element not found 

// 6. The key idea behind binary search is that it divides the search space in half with each step, resulting in a logarithmic time complexity of O(log n), where n is the size of the array.
